# Web-Based Raster Drawing Application

A web application that lets users draw on an HTML5 canvas using tools like ellipse, circle, rectangle, and line, with real-time mouse preview. It allows selecting line color and thickness, changing the background color even after drawing, and exporting the final image as a raster file or a vector file (SVG) containing the actual drawn shapes.
